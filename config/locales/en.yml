            It's the most convenient way to come!<br/>La Boussac is not on any
            main road, so trust your GPS (see the other tab for the full
            addresses of all the main places in La Boussac).<br/>If you're
            leaving from a place where a lot of our guests live (ie: Paris,
            Grenoble, or Nantes) and you still have spots in the car, please let
            us know so that we could inform potentially interested people.

            Unless you plan on coming on your own once in Rennes, <b>DO NOT take
            the train and stop in Rennes</b>.<br/>The closest train station to
            La Boussac is <b>Dol-de-Bretagne</b>.<br/>It is on the direct train
            service between Paris and Saint-Malo, and is a 10 minutes drive from
            La Boussac.<br/>It's the most convenient options <b>both for you and
            for us</b>.<br/>We can organize shuttles between Dol and La Boussac,
            just let us know so that we can synchronize everyone.

            If you live in Paris, Grenoble, or Nantes it's very likely someone
            else is coming by car. If you drop us a mail we could put you in
            touch with people having available spots in their
            cars.<br/>Alternatively you can check out <a
            href="https://www.blablacar.fr" target="_blank">Blablacar</a>. If no
            one goes through La Boussac, try to get dropped in <b>Dol de
            Bretagne</b>.

            The closest airport is in Rennes, but the most convenient is likely

            It's the only free option, and it's also the closest to the Hall and
            to the family house!<br/>Obviously the comfort has to be cut down a
            little, but to be honest, at 4 am during the party night, your floor
            mat will feel as comfy as a top-notch 4 stars hotel.<br/>We have
            several spaces for tents, please contact us if you are interested.
